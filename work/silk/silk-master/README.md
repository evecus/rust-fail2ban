# silk

A minimal transparent proxy built on the honk/dae kernel datapath design:
eBPF steers traffic in the kernel, **direct traffic never reaches
userspace** — only flows the kernel verdicts as "proxy" enter this process,
which relays them to the configured outbound (SOCKS5 or Hysteria2).

Reuses honk's architecture (veth-pair proxy netns, TC hooks, sk_lookup,
DNS-derived per-IP domain routing) with a drastically trimmed map surface
(7 maps instead of 40+) and a small, single-binary userspace.

## Layout

```
silk-ebpf-common/   shared kernel<->userspace ABI (no_std)
silk-ebpf/          eBPF programs (aya-ebpf, standalone crate)
silk/         userspace: loader, netns, listeners, outbounds (SOCKS5/Hysteria2), DNS engine
```

### eBPF programs (4 + sk_lookup)

| Program              | Hook                      | Role |
|----------------------|---------------------------|------|
| `lan_ingress`        | TC ingress, LAN iface     | gateway capture |
| `wan_egress`         | TC egress, WAN iface      | host-originated capture |
| `silk0peer_ingress`   | TC ingress, silk0peer      | restore skb mark inside `silkns` |
| `silk0_ingress`       | TC ingress, silk0          | restore reply framing, TX back |
| `sk_lookup`          | netns `silkns`             | assign conns to transparent listeners |

### Maps

`FLOW_TRACK` (reply framing) · `DOMAIN_ROUTE` (per-IP verdicts from DNS) ·
`CIDR_V4/V6` (LPM) · `PORT_ROUTE` · `LISTEN_SOCKETS` (sockmap) ·
`SK_IDENTITY` (sk_storage loop-prevention) · `PARAM` (global config).

### Routing decision (kernel, first match wins)

1. DNS hijack — UDP dport 53 → userspace DNS engine
2. `DOMAIN_ROUTE` — per-IP verdict published by the DNS engine
3. CIDR longest-prefix match
4. Port table
5. `general.default_verdict`

`direct` → `TC_ACT_OK` (never touches userspace); `block` → dropped;
`proxy` → marked + recorded in `FLOW_TRACK` + redirected into the `silkns`
proxy namespace, where sk_lookup hands the flow to the transparent
listeners in this process.

### Domain routing

eBPF never inspects domain strings. The DNS engine matches domain rules
against queried names, then publishes a verdict for **every IP** in the
answer into `DOMAIN_ROUTE`. Subsequent data packets to those IPs route by
domain — dae's trick, simplified.

### Loop prevention

Every outbound control-plane socket (SOCKS5 dial, Hysteria2 QUIC endpoint,
DNS upstream) is marked with `SO_MARK` (visible as `skb->mark`) *and*
carries an sk_storage flag; `wan_egress` passes sockets carrying either.

## Sniffing & dial-by-domain

Proxied TCP flows arrive as bare IPs. `[sniff]` (on by default) peeks at the
client's first bytes (up to 4 KiB, 300 ms window) for a TLS SNI or HTTP
`Host`, then:

- re-runs the domain rules on it: `direct` is dialled locally (control-plane
  marked), `block` is dropped;
- dials the proxy exit by name (SOCKS5 ATYP 3 / Hysteria2 `host:port`), so the
  exit resolves it itself.

Without a sniffed name, the DNS engine's IP→domain memory is used, but only
when the address maps to exactly one live name. Servers that speak first
(SSH, SMTP) are probed at most three times per destination, then skipped for
ten minutes. QUIC/UDP sniffing code is in `sniffer.rs` but not wired in.

## Per-process policy (cgroup v2)

`[[cgroups]]` entries bind a cgroup v2 path to `bypass` (never captured) or
`proxy` (public destinations forced through the proxy). The eBPF side asks
`bpf_skb_ancestor_cgroup_id()` for the socket's cgroup ancestry, so a rule
covers the whole subtree and the deepest match wins. Only host-originated
traffic is affected, and the lookup is skipped entirely when no rule is
configured. Needs cgroup v2 and a kernel with `CONFIG_CGROUPS`. Put a
program in a cgroup with a systemd unit or
`systemd-run --scope -p Slice=... <cmd>`.

## Outbounds

`general.outbound` selects the protocol:

- `socks5` — `[socks5]` section: server, optional user/pass auth.
- `hysteria2` — `[hysteria2]` section: server (`host:port`), password,
  sni, insecure, and optional `up`/`down` bandwidth. Implemented over QUIC
  (quinn) with raw HTTP/3 auth, sing-box-matching windows, BBR congestion
  control (Brutal-like initial window when `up` is set); TCP via QUIC
  streams, UDP via QUIC datagrams with fragmentation/reassembly. The
  server hostname is resolved before the eBPF hooks attach, so lookups
  never loop through the datapath.

## Shutdown & cleanup

SIGINT/SIGTERM trigger an orderly teardown: the netlink-attached TC
filters (`tc qdisc del ... clsact`), the `silk0` veth bridge and the
`silkns` namespace are all removed — they outlive the process
otherwise. The same cleanup runs if a relay loop dies.

## Rulesets

- `kind = "source"` (alias `list`): plain list **or** sing-box JSON. Parsed into
  ordinary domain/cidr rules — **no FST at startup** (fine for small sets).
- `kind = "binary"`: ARST FST ruleset for large domain lists, stored as an
  extensionless binary file (self-identifying via its ARST magic). Convert with:
  ```sh
  silk --convert-ruleset geosite-cn.json          # -> geosite-cn
  silk --convert-ruleset geosite-cn.json -o cn-domain
  # also accepts plain .list text
  ```
  Then reference `kind = "binary"`, `value = "/etc/silk/cn-domain"`.

## Requirements

- Linux ≥ 6.6 (TCX/SchedClassifier attach; developed against honk's 6.12+ target)
- root privileges (TC, sk_lookup, netns, IP_TRANSPARENT)
- `iproute2` (`ip`, `tc`), and an outbound server (SOCKS5 with CONNECT +
  UDP ASSOCIATE, or a Hysteria2 server)

## Build

Default release binary is **fully static musl** (`*-unknown-linux-musl`).
A glibc (gnu) build remains possible if you omit the musl target.

```sh
# 0. Toolchain
rustup toolchain install stable
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-musl   # or x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
# Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install -y musl-tools
# (provides musl-gcc / aarch64-linux-musl-gcc on native hosts)

# 1. eBPF object (nightly, bpf-linker)
rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly
# Prefer the prebuilt bpf-linker matching your arch, e.g.:
#   https://github.com/aya-rs/bpf-linker/releases
# Or build from source — bpf-linker must match rustc nightly's LLVM
# (rustc +nightly -vV | grep llvm-version). Example for LLVM-22 on Ubuntu 24.04:
#   apt-get install -y llvm-22-dev libpolly-22-dev
#   LLVM_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/llvm-22/bin/llvm-config \
#   RUSTFLAGS="-L /usr/lib/llvm-22/lib -C link-arg=-Wl,-rpath,/usr/lib/llvm-22/lib" \
#     cargo install bpf-linker --version 0.11.1 --no-default-features --features llvm-22

cd silk-ebpf
cargo +nightly build --release -Zbuild-std=core --target bpfel-unknown-none

# 2. Userspace — musl static (recommended)
cd ..
export RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+crt-static -C link-self-contained=yes"
cargo +stable build --release --features ebpf \
  --target aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
# binary: target/aarch64-unknown-linux-musl/release/silk
# check: file ... && ldd ...   # expect "statically linked" / "not a dynamic executable"

# Optional: glibc (gnu) dynamic build
# cargo +stable build --release --features ebpf
# binary: target/release/silk
```

Note: bpf-linker's LLVM must match the rustc nightly's bundled LLVM —
older linkers (0.9.x) can't read LLVM 22 bitcode; 0.11.x needs a matching
system LLVM for the chosen feature.

## Run

```sh
# musl static build
sudo ./silk -c config.example.yaml
# or:
# sudo silk -c /etc/silk/config.yaml
```

Rules live in the YAML config (see `config.example.yaml`): CIDR, port,
domain-suffix, and ruleset-file (`source`/`binary`) rules with
`direct`/`block`/node-name verdicts. `direct` and `block` are resolved
in the kernel; a node name captures the flow into userspace and forwards
it through that node.

## What's intentionally missing (vs honk)

- No geoip/geosite databases, no logic/parameter expressions
- TCP/UDP via SOCKS5, Hysteria2 or VLESS (no Salamander/Gecko obfuscation)
- Only plain UDP/53 DNS hijack (no DoH/DoT interception)
- No fragment reassembly routing (fragments fall through to
  address/port-less surfaces like dae)
